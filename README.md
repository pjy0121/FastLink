# FastLink

## üöÄ Introduction

With **FastLink**, you can assign global hotkeys, search, organize, and launch everything you need‚Äî
faster and more flexibly than any built-in bookmark or shortcut system.

**Tired of scattered browser bookmarks and clunky file system shortcuts?**  
Traditional browser favorites and file/folder shortcuts are often limited to a single browser or device, hard to organize, and slow to access‚Äî<br>
especially when you use multiple browsers, cloud drives, or work across different folders and apps. Managing dozens of bookmarks, desktop shortcuts, and favorites can quickly become a mess.

**FastLink** is an open-source, modern Windows launcher and hotkey manager that brings all your favorite files, folders, websites, and commands together in one place‚Äîalways just a click or hotkey away.

- No more hunting through browser menus or desktop icons.
- No more duplicate bookmarks across browsers or complex folder structures.
- No more limits: launch anything, from anywhere, instantly.

## üèÜ Main Features

- **Add Hotkey:**  
  - (Default) Ctrl + Shift + F1
  - Instantly add the current Explorer or browser path as a new link.
  - When adding a web page, we recommend using the 'Microsoft Edge' browser.
  - The latest 'Google Chrome' browser has enhanced security, so some web pages do not recognize the path properly or are recognized properly only during page transitions.
